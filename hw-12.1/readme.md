### Work Summary
I attempted to create an Invader shooter game where different objects interacted with each other. I took a lot of notes on Shiffman's videos and implamented them into my code. I wanted to replace the ellipses that move back and forth on the canvas to be flower png, but my code kept breaking and it said I needed a local server and when I attempted to create one through python, it just wouldn't work. So...my *flowers* are just lousy circles.

I added three *classes* on seperate .js files, since Shiffman recommended that, and it made my code much easier to read. I also learned how important the index.html file encompasses, since every new .js file I had I needed to add to my html file.
```

        /* <script src="p5_lib/p5.min.js"></script>
        <script src="p5_lib/p5.dom.min.js"></script>
        <script src="p5_lib/p5.sound.min.js"></script>
        <script src="sketch.js"></script> */
        <script src="ship.js"></script>
        <script src="flower.js"></script>
        <script src="drop.js"></script>

```
I would love to be able to add a point system to this, actually figure out how to add images, perhaps instead of the flowers growing they would dissappear, and if they did reach the spaceship it would be **Game Over**

I'm not sure what the final is, but hopefully there will be enough liberty for me to incorporate this sketch again.
