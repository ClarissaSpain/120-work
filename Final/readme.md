### Summary
  A lonely desert town struggles with a sudden drought, they ask you to save them. Whilst investigating, you find yourself against a crabby ol' desert witch. Who, conviently announces, that she's the reason for the sudden drought. Upon inquiry for her actions, the witch reciprocates.
  "One evening I was out collecting good ol' shrubbery for me here hut, when these cactuses --"
  "Cacti" you correct.
  The witch slowly blinks at you "--HERE PRICKLY DEMONS POKED ME IN THE BUM."
  "They sure might poke you."
  "So I cursed these lands for a hundred year drought to kill all these cactuses."
  "--cacti"
  "I know what I said and I won't say it again!"
  "It's cacti though..." you reply. "Also wouldn't a drought kill everything else here and aren't cacti built to withstand droughts?"
  "Do you wanna play the game or not?" squealed the witch.
  "I suppose I am the hero afterall."
