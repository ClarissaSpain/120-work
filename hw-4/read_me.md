### What steps did you make to complete this assignment?
1. Made a sketch and tried to make it as simple as possible for the project.

2. Created a 500 x 500 canvas.
3. Started with the big shapes and worked my way into the smaller shapes/details.
```html
/*  */making the overall shape.
push();
// make sweater pink
fill( 'rgb(236, 185, 199)' );
    // remove stroke
    noStroke();
//Shape for the sweater
beginShape();
vertex( 85, 375);
vertex( 125, 400);
vertex( 245, 435);
