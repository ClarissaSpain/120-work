## Weekly Q/A
### Summary
This week I made an illustration in pf.js script and learned the following:
- The basics of drawing (Read chapter 1 and 3 from the book)
- 2D Shapes
- Coloring
- Shape function transformations
- Order of Operations
- The Error Console

### Steps
 1. Made a sketch and tried to make it as simple as possible for the project.

 2. Created a 500 x 500 canvas.
 3. Started with the big shapes and worked my way into the smaller shapes/details.
 ```html
      /*  */making the overall shape.
      push();
      // make sweater pink

          // remove stroke
          noStroke();
      //Shape for the sweater
      beginShape();
      vertex( 85, 375);
      vertex( 125, 400);
      vertex( 245, 435);
```

 4. I added a 10 x 10 grid on top of the drawing and found the points and then mulitplied those numbers by 50 in order to get each individual vertex for my canvas.

### Issues
  I didn't really have any issues with this project becuase it was pretty straightfoward.
### Further Discussion
For the most part I used beginShape to create the sketch. I wanted to make sure I was
### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out this week?
