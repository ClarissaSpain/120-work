### Work Summary
My intentions for this week's assignment was to create a smoke particle affect and have it follow the curser. I wanted it to change color everytime there was a click, but I kept breaking my code and didn't work out by the end. Otherwise, everytime the page is reloaded the color of the particles do change.
