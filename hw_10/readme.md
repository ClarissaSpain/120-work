## Summary of the work
After going through the lesson on the website, I read the function's Chapter in the book **Make: Getting Started in p5.js**
1. My first step was to decide on what object I wanted to create. I decided to make a cactus. After completing my drawing I made it into a function and added it to my function draw() that would be repeated as so:
```
background('pink');
for (var x = -35; x < width + 70; x += 70) {
  cactus( x, 50);
```
2. I tried everything I could to set up an array and it would always break my code. I've never been successful with setting variables or using 'let'.
3. Then I realized I needed two new functions, so I created a ball function that rolls back and forth on the screen. Pretty random, but still cute.
