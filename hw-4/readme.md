## Weekly Q/A
### Summarize the Work you did this week.
This week I made an illustration in pf.js script.
- The basics of drawing
- 2D Primitive Shapes
- Color in p5
- Shape function transformations
- Order of Operations
- The Error Console
### What steps did you make to complete this assignment?
 1. Made a sketch and tried to make it as simple as possible for the project.

        ![Original Sketch in Procreate](img/sketch.JPG "original sketch")
  2. Created a 500 x 500 canvas.
 3. Started with the big shapes and worked my way into the smaller shapes/details.
 <!-- ```html

      push();
      // make sweater pink
      fill( 'rgb(236, 185, 199)' );
          // remove stroke
          noStroke();
      //Shape for the sweater
      beginShape();
      vertex( 85, 375);
      vertex( 125, 400);
      vertex( 245, 435);
``` -->

  4. I added a 10 x 10 grid on top of the drawing and found the points and then mulitplied those numbers by 50 in order to get the point onto my canvas.

### Issues? Resolutions? Classmate feedback?

### Anything in particular that you would like to discuss further?
For the most part I used beginShape to create the sketch. I wanted to make sure I was
