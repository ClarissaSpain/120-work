## Weekly Q/A
### Summarize the Work you did this week.
I continued to address the materials from [Unix for the Beginning Mage](http://unixmages.com/ufbm.pdf) tutorial by Joe Topjion. The whimsical storytelling method of teaching the material has most benefitted my understanding of my Macbook's Terminal. Furthermore, I created a github account and downloaded subsequent programs to code, such as Atom, Github Desktop, and xcode. Lastly, I have overviewed and continuing to practice using Markdown to create this webpage.

### What steps did you make to complete this assignment?
 - In Atom I kept the [test2.md](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/markup/) material that was provided on the website in a different tab next to my current assignment for reference.
 - First I answered all of the homework questions, *without thinking about how my webpage was going to look.*
 - Then I referred to the preview, proofread and added additional text, links, and photos to make it more appealing.
 - Finally, I uploaded my webpage to Github and posted the link to the discussion board on Moodle.
