## Weekly Q/A
### Summarize the Work you did this week.
I continued to address the materials from [Unix for the Beginning Mage](http://unixmages.com/ufbm.pdf) tutorial by Joe Topjion. The storytelling method of teaching the material has been the best benefit for my understanding of my Macbook's Terminal. Furthermore, I created a github account and downloaded subsequent programs to code, such as Atom, Github Desktop, and xcode. Lastly, I have overviewed and continuing to practice using Markdown to create this webpage.

### What steps did you make to complete this assignment?
 - In Atom I kept the [test2.md](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/markup/) material that was provided on the website in a different tab next to my current assignment for reference.
 - First I answered all of the homework questions, *without thinking about how my webpage was going to look.*
 - Then I referred to the preview, proofread and added additional text, links, and photos to make it more appealing.
 - Through Terminal I made a copy of the markdown file and stripped it down to an outline. I renamed it Master_copy for future ease.
 - Finally, I uploaded my webpage to Github and posted the link to the discussion board on Moodle.

### Issues? Resolutions? Classmate feedback?
My biggest issue was adding any images. It felt like a hit or miss, because I wasn't able to see it in the Atom preview and it seemed like it was a broken link. After some further research I was able to fix it. Now, there may be easier ways to do this and I'm open to anyone explaining it to me. Currently my process is uploading my picture onto [amazonaws](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), there the website stores the image and creates an URL. I make the image public, and With the URl I can then copy and paste into my markdown file and people are able to view it from anywhere. My next issue was sizing and that's where the html that I have provided below comes in.
```html
<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/gitwebsite/Cactus-Logo.png"
alt="Baby Cactus" style="width: 150px;"/>
```
I really wanted to be able to have a name appear when someone hovers their mouse above the image but I wasn't able to do that and get the sizing. It was either one or the other in my experience.
### Anything in particular that you would like to discuss further?

### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out this week?

I had a lot of fun throwing in a quick illustration of a cactus named Caspian.
